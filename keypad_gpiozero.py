##### WARNING #####
This code is FAR from ready.


I tested this code with a 3x4 keypad (`12345679*0#`). It doesn't work well.
The probing code seems to work, but everything else around it is messy and
unreliable. I'm abandoning this code for now.

I originally tried to pick the best of these two pieces of code:
https://github.com/brettmclean/pad4pi/blob/develop/pad4pi/rpi_gpio.py
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MatrixKeypad/blob/main/adafruit_matrixkeypad.py
Plus bits from gpiozero's ButtonBoard and Rotary Encoder.

My idea was to use interrupts to get notified of button state changes, and then
react to those by probing all the keys to find the real states of the buttons,
and then revert back to waiting.

Sidenote: these aren't real interrupts; the `raspberry-gpio-python` internally
runs a polling loop to look for changes, and then calls your callback. It gives
the illusion of interrupts, but they are technically not interrupts. Or maybe
they are, and I completely misunderstood the code while taking a quick look.
https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/code/ci/default/tree/source/event_gpio.c#l357

Unfortunately, it didn't work as intended. Since the polling and the callback
run in a different thread, I'm now dealing with racing conditions and all the
trouble that comes with multi-thread coding (with the extra difficulty that I
don't have control over the other threads).

When I was pressing buttons from the first two columns (`147`, `258`),
everything worked fine (or good enough). However, randomly when pressing
buttons on the third column (`369`) the code would enter an infinite callback
loop. It seemed like the `_probe_keypad` would finish the setup and reactivate
the callbacks too quickly, so the library code was detecting some edge change
on the pin 13 and calling my callback, which would trigger another probe, which
would self-sustain this madness. Why only on pin 13? Was it because it was the
last one in the columns loop. Or maybe it was luck (AKA racing condition).

My last hope was to try adding a basic debouncing code by using a `Timer`
object. Well, that works, the infinite calling of callbacks was halted. But it
also means the code is now eating inputs, so it is unreliable in a different
way.

For now, I give up on this approach. If someone else wants to give it a try, be
my guest. Maybe someone somewhere will be able to make it work.

My next approach will be simplified: the class will work in two ways: either
manual probing (the user of the class will call a method or read from a
property/generator to trigger the probing), or automatic probing (a background
thread that will probe the values at a certain frequency, with optional
debouncing).

        # * Setup:
        #   - All pins are input.
        #   - Choose one line (either row or col), set as output. This will provide "power" to detect an edge later.
        #      - Actually, we need to set all lines.
        #   - Set all pins from the perpendicular line as detecting an edge, and provide a callback function.
        #
        # * Callback function:
        #   - Start by disabling further calls to this function until later.
        #   - Run the polling algorithm (disable all but one line, read, repeat for the next line, repeatâ€¦)
        #      - "Disable" means switching to INPUT.
        #   - The result will be zero, one, or many keys detected.
        #   - Re-enable the function. Must test if it's not being called multiple times. Looking at the ticks parameter might help.
        #
        # * We probably need multiple callback functions, one per line.

        #   difference.
