# I have a new idea:
#
# * Create a pseudo-button class that inherits from `HoldMixin` and
#   `InternalDevice`.
# * Make `MatrixKeypad` be a composite device of all these fake buttons.
# * Store the row/col pins outside the `CompositeDevice` stuff.
# * Override `close()` and `closed`. They should act on the row/col pins.
# * Override `__repr__`, if I can think of a better representation.
# * Let the buttons be accessible in multiple ways:
#     * By single index (`CompositeDevice` already provides that).
#     * By (rowno, colno).
#     * By label (`CompositeDevice` provides a limited version of that,
#       because only valid identifiers are accessible), either by
#       attribute or in a dict-like interface.
# * Provide some custom callback code that passes the exact buttons as
#   parameters. This involves passing and/or comparing `_previous_value`
#   with `_last_value`.
#     * Parameters
#         * Current key state
#         * Previous key state
#         * Newly-pressed keys (redundant?)
#         * Newly-released keys (redundant?)
#         * Is it ambiguous now? Was it ambiguous before?
#     * Callbacks
#         * Key press (which ones are now pressed?)
#         * Key release (which ones are now released?)
#         * Key hold (do I need it?)
#         * KeypadChange (one callback to rule them all)
#
# Advantages:
#
# * `HoldMixin` will work out-of-the-box, because it will handle a single
#   button.
# * No one will accidentally touch the hardware pins by accidentally using
#   the `CompositeDevice` interface.
# * Easy-to-use for people who want to make the keypad behave like a
#   keyboard (i.e. one callback for all buttons).
# * Easy-to-use for people who want finer access to individual buttons.
#
# For this new implementation idea, it might be worth reverting to the
# previous commit (the one without HoldMixin).
#
# I'll still need to implement an optional background polling thread.

        results. However, almost all matrix keypads are very simple, containing
        nothing other than the buttons themselves. Such keypads assume the user
        will not press multiple keys at once.

        button is pressed while it isn't). If you don't need to deal with this
        large amount of simultaneous button presses, you don't need to worry

        than what most people need. (Most people just need a single button
        press.)

        Matrix keypads are extremely simple devices: one wire for each row, one
        wire for each column, and a button connecting each row/column pair.
        Thus, if three buttons are pressed in a certain way (sharing both a
        row wire and a column wire), then a fourth button press will be read by
        the circuit, even if that fourth button is not pressed. In such case,
        the value is ambiguous, because the code reads four buttons, but it's
        impossible to know if all four are pressed, or which one of those four
        buttons is not pressed.

        As another way to understand it, any read that contains four buttons as
        corners of a rectangle is ambiguous.

        * Zero buttons pressed are never ambiguous.
        * One button pressed is never ambiguous.
        * Two buttons pressed is never ambiguous.
        * Three buttons read as pressed is never ambiguous.

        include ghost presses).
